### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/souzabruno01/CapyType-Race.git
   cd CapyType-Race/capytype
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   
   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   **Frontend (.env)**
   ```env
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```
   
   **Backend (.env)**
   ```env
   PORT=3001
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
   ```

4. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## üåê Production Deployment

### Frontend (Firebase)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

### Backend (Render/Railway)
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set environment variables:
   - `FRONTEND_URL`: Your Firebase hosting URL
   - `CORS_ORIGIN`: Your Firebase hosting URL + localhost for development

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Enter your nickname** on the login screen
2. **Choose your capybara avatar** by clicking on the capybara face (10 colors available)
3. **Create a room** or **join an existing room** with a room ID
4. **Wait in the lobby** for other players to join (you'll see colorful player cards)
5. **Customize your color** anytime in the lobby using the edit button on your player card
6. **Generate race text** (host only) - Choose a topic and character limit or use random text
7. **Start the game** when ready (room admin only)
8. **Type the displayed text** as fast and accurately as possible (green for correct, red for errors)
9. **View results** and compare your performance with others

## üìä Game Metrics

- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Typing speed calculation
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
- **Errors**: Number of mistakes made
- **Position**: Your rank among all players

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### "Failed to connect to server"
- **Cause**: Backend URL misconfiguration
- **Solution**: Update `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in frontend `.env` file

### CORS Errors
- **Cause**: Frontend domain not allowed in backend CORS
- **Solution**: Add your domain to `CORS_ORIGIN` in backend `.env` file

### "Invalid room code" when trying to join
- **Cause**: Room does not exist or has been closed
- **Solution**: Double-check the room code or create a new room
